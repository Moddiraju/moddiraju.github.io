                        <h4>
                            The exoskeleton was designed with the intention of translating a human arm's 7 Degrees-of-Freedom
                            into a standard industrial arm's 6 Degrees-of-Freedom. The primary industrial arm was
                        </br>
                        </br>
                            The industrial arm was primarily autonomous, unloading boxes from containers using computer vision, the goal
                            of this project was to assist the arm in edge cases where the industrial arm would fail to understand its
                            environment.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                            Due to the nature of the arm and end-effector, the pronation/supination rotational axis of the wrist was
                            replaced with a joystick that controlled the end-effector.

                        <h4>
                            The controls for this project were shelved before being tested, however I was able to learn about 
                            Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics while developing an exoskeleton-to-industrial-arm mapping
                            algorithm
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Each Degree-of-Freedom of the exoskeleton has an incremental and absolute encoder mounted, to keep track of rotational motion.
                            The arm "lengths" (i.e. the distances between the rotational joints) are not adjustable besides the shoulder to elbow length.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Knowing both the mechanical dimensions and the angles of rotation at all six joints, you can develop a series of 
                            transformational matrices for pose using the <strong>Denavit-Hartenberg</strong> parameters. This 
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            We can run the STM32 at a lower clock speed such as 120MHz so that the heat produced by the chip is minimal.
                            Even at this speed, the bottleneck in performance will be the LTC's conversion time at around 100ms per Thermocouple.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Once conversions are complete, the temperature data is dumped into a circular buffer which is then exported over UART
                            to a csv (via a pyserial data logger). The STM's high speed ensures that a large buffer is unnecessary as we can select a
                            high baud rate to ensure the buffer drains much faster than it is filled.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            The main.c file will initialize all necessary parts and contain the primary software loop ensuring the thermocouple to csv
                            pipeline continues as long as the python file requests data.
