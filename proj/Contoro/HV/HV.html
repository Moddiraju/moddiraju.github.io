                            <h4>
                                The goal of this project was to isolate all High-Voltage (>48V) components on the Unloading Robot
                                into an enclosure that is water-resistant. The enclosure only needed to survive moisture build-up and
                                short rain exposure (such as the small uncovered gap present at loading docks).

                            </br>
                            </br>
                                This was accomplished via a powdercoated 5052-H32 enclosure that was grounded and mounted
                                to the chassis of the robot. This enclosure had 3 480V inlet ports, 4 120V outlet ports, and
                                a water-resistant cable pass through to power various robot peripherals.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                                The enclosure itself was designed with various mounting plates within (all grounded to the main enclosure)
                                to rapidly mount/dismount components as needed. It also had a handle which connected to the main breaker,
                                thereby acting as an easily accesible E-Stop.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                                The required airflow can be calculated using the standard HVAC sensible heat equation:
                                $$CFM = \frac{\text{Sensible Heat (BTU/h)}}{1.08 \times \Delta T}$$

                                Where we can derive the Sensible Heat from efficiencies listed in the datasheet for each component
                                enclosed. This drove fan sizing, with a \(\Delta T = 10 ^\circ \text{C}\) being deemed reasonable.
