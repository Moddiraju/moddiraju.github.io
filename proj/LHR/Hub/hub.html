                        <h4>
                            The front wheel hub's geometry was driven by two sources:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Wheel dimensions, set by the OZ Racing 10" CL wheels we chose due to the
                                    weight savings and impressive price
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Bearing size, which is determined by choosing from the options offered to
                                    us for free from SKF Bearings
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            After establishing both of these parts as fit & function requirements, the wheel hub was developed
                            in iterations to minimize mass while passing FEA. This included loading in the following conditions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Hard Braking (Torque transmitted through the Rotor mount flange)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Hard Acceleration (Torque transmitted through the Wheel mount flange)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Cornering (Axial force through the hub, transmitted via the preloaded bearings to the upright)
                                </li>
                            </ul> 
                        </h4>
                    </article>
                    <article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
                        <h3>Material Selection</h3>
                        <h4>
                            We chose Alumnimum 7075-T6 as it was familiar, machinable, and had a great strength-to-weight ratio.
                            Although it lacks an endurance limit (as opposed to steel), this fatigue concern was largely irrelevant
                            since the fatigue curve predicted failure in excess of $10^8$ cycles, which we did not expect achieve with
                            our "100 miles before competition" internal target.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                            Additionally, the thermal characterstics of 7075-T6 were acceptable. The yield strength of this material hits
                            a "cliff" at $\sim 150^\circ C$, which is well outside reasonable operating temperatures. A bigger concern was
                            the thermal expansion coefficient, at $2.3\frac{\mu m}{m-^\circ C}$. To ensure that heat conduction to the hub
                            was minimal, we introduced thermal resistance between the brake rotor (the primary heat source) and the rotor
                            mounting flange on the hub by floating the rotor with titanium brake buttons. This ensured no direct contact between
                            the rotor and the hub, and with titanium having a low thermal conductivity of $6.7 \frac{W}{m-^\circ K}$, there were
                            significant barriers to heat flow into the hub.

                    <article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
                        <h3>Calculations</h3>
                        <h4>
                            Six Dowel pins were installed in shear to transmit torques from the wheel to the hub. Using the following
                            equation:

                            $$\tau_{pin} = \frac{F_L \times r_{tire}}{r_{pin}\times \text{\# of pins} \times \frac{\pi}{4}d_{pin}^2}$$

                            we can calculate the shear stress on any given pin, and to ensure that the reacting flanges don't tear out,
                            we can use the following equation (utilizing some of the values calculated above):

                            $$\sigma_{bearing} = \frac{F_{pin}}{d_{pin} \times \text{pin engagement}}$$

                            We use this "projected area" to account for the fact that the pin cannot pull the hub, it can only push,
                            therefore a calculation with the full contact area would yield an incorrectly high FOS.
                            To avoid this trap, we check the FOS using the projected area in hand calcs, and we then validate these
                            calcs in ANSYS FEA.

                            This part is still the most labor-intensive (and injury intensive, more on that later)
                            part I have ever been involved in machining. The high-level operations went as follows:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Turning and Boring the raw 4" McMaster cylinder stock (I only did half
                                    as a chuck jaw failed during one of my turning passes and launched the part at my stomach
                                    and putting me on a machining break), this formed the main flanges and form of the hub.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    CAM in HSMWorks (RIP) to CNC Mill the threads, brake button cutouts, and dowel pin holes.
                                </li>
                            The most annoying part of this entire process was checking fit with the brake rotor and brake buttons
                            and then shaving off another 0.0005" as needed to ensure there was no radial play in the buttons while
                            allowing them to be installed with ease.
