                            Although the rules for braking systems have varied mildly over the years, the major requirements that
                            drive the design have been static and are paraphrased as follows from the 2026 FSAE Rules:

                                <li>

                                    T.3.1.3: There must be two independent hydraulic circuits, each with their own fluid reservoirs
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    T.3.2.1: The brake pedal must be made from steel, aluminum or titanium
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    T.3.2.2: The brake pedal must withstand 2000N (or a judge's strongest stomp) 
                                    at the pedal face without any failures in the system
                                </li>
                                <li>

				<h2>2024-25 (Brakes Lead)</h2>
                <h4>
                    For the 2024-25 season, the Brakes system was split off from the unsprung sub-system again as it proved to be an
                    excessive amount of work for one subteam to handle. As I had the most experience with Brakes, I was chosen to lead
                    this subsystem.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    This was the first year that the brakes subsystem had more than 2 people on it, therefore we made it a mission this
                    year to question EVERY choice and justify all design choices from first principles or from a practicality standpoint.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Notable changes during this year include the rotors losing their holes, as these were removed in favor of small, 
                    dust-clearing divots. This ensured that the surface area of the rotor was maximized for both braking torque and
                    cooling purposes.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Another notable change in the assembly was the switch to Titanium grade-5 brake buttons. This was driven by
                    circumstance as the UT Austin Machine shop had limited student access, so more parts needed to be outsourced, and
                    Titanium brake buttons were very similar in price to 4140 but offered major advantages in weight, strength, and thermal 
                    resistance (4.45$\frac{g}{cm^3}$, 6.7$\frac{W}{m^\circ K}$ vs. 7.85$\frac{g}{cm^3}$, 42.6$\frac{W}{m^\circ K}$).

                            After a design judge told us our most FSAE brake rotors were "an aesthetic expression" instead of designed
                            around functionality, we went back to the drawing board and came up with a new front brake rotor that
                            was capable of achieving locking torque and while keeping temperatures minimal.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            There was also a lot more testing put into the thermals of this part, such as checking rotor temps after
                            an autocross event, applying thermal paint to the rotors (failed), and installing rotor monitoring thermal
                            cameras (16x16 px, 1 Hz sampling was too slow to provide any real value).

                        <h4>
                            Once again, due to packaging issues, we had to modify our rear brakes down to one rotor. Calculations indicated 
                            that one rotor with a P2.24 caliper would easily provide the torque necessary to lock the rear 
                            wheels if we were willing to run higher line pressures (within the burst rating of the 
                            master cylinders and calipers), but braking through the diff would cause constant understeer.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Another complication that arose for rear braking was the reintroduction of regenerative braking from the motor,
                            this meant that the hydraulic braking torque had to be varied based on battery SOC and motor RPM. I will discuss
                            this more below.

				<h2>2023-24 (Unsprung Member)</h2>
                <h4>
                    During my second year, the brakes system was absorbed by the hierarchically larger "Unsprung" system and the
                    rear brakes once again shifted inboard as packaging issues were resolved. During this year I was
                    also involved in the design of the 
                    <a href="../Hub/hub.html">
                        Front Wheel Hub
                    </a>
                    as it made integration much easier to have one person own the design of two components that fit together.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    I was able to continue positive relations with COTS suppliers from the previous years to receive another
                    free set of P2.34 to use as front calipers, and in addition I was able to acquire a set of P2.24 calipers
                    for the rear of the vehicle.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    A notable design change during this year was the switch to 4140 Hot-Rolled Steel Rotors and slotting the rotors 
                    instead of drilling them for pocketing and dust clearing. This design change was made as we (me) had 
                    fractures in rotor blanks during manufacturing the previous year, and we hoped switching to a more ductile material
                    would reduce some of these failures (0.5% elongation vs. 10% elongation).
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    A large amount of this year's design changes were aimed at easier manufacturing from experiences the previous year,
                    this included features such as dowel pin holes/slots (to rotationally locate the rotors in our mini mills).

                            The geometry of the front brake rotor followed a similar design philosophy to the previous year,
                            with very minor changes being made to the exterior as that region did not contact the brake pad.

                            The slotting on this rotor was a little less arbitrary in that it only existed where the brake pad
                            contacted and had chamfers. This was aimed at clearing any dust/debris that accumulated on the brake pads, and
                            the angle in the slots was to ensure that braking force (dictated by pad contact area) remained constant
                            irrespective of rotation.

                            Similar to the previous year, the rear brake rotor geometry was mostly a modification of the front brake rotor.
                            However, unlike the previous year, inboard brakes posed a much nicer packaging constraint, allowing us to utilize
                            a larger caliper and a smaller rotor.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Although inboard brakes introduced compliance into the system via the torsion of the driveshaft, it was
                            deemed necessary as the tripod increased in size over the previous year; this made it impossible to package
                            brake rotors and calipers in the rear unsprung assembly without major assembly and clearance issues.

				<h2>2022-23 (First Year Student)</h2>
                <h4>
                    As a freshman at UT Austin, I was assigned the design of brake rotors and relevant COTS Selection
                    as my responsibilities. This included sourcing brake calipers (which I procured for free) and sourcing
                    master cylinders compatible with the pedal box.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    This year was a rebuild year for the team at large as the dynamics team grew from 4 people to 18 (of which
                    all new members were freshman). This also meant that there was next to zero knowledge transfer 
                    from upperclassmen, forcing me to derive all designs from scratch with very little reference material.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    As a result, to produce a viable rotor in a reasonable amount of time, we opted to continue with Gray Cast Iron
                    as our material choice.

                            The geometry of the brake rotor was aimed primarily at ensuring the largest amount of contact with the brake
                            pad while being able to be packaged within the front unsprung assembly. 
                            </br>
                            </br>    
                            This meant that the outer diameter was driven entirely by the size of the wheel, and the 
                            inner diameter was driven by the inner radius of our chosen caliper's 
                            (Brembo P2.34 as they were offered for free) brake pad.

                            Although the pocketing on this rotor serves to clear dust from the pads, the choice to use drilled holes
                            and the locations of the holes were arbitrary.

                            The geometry of the rear brake rotor was defined similarly to the front brake rotors, but the main difference
                            being extremely tight packaging constraints required a smaller caliper to be utilized (Wilwood GP200).
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Outboard packaging in the rear was extremely tight as the inner diameter of the rotor was constrained by
                            the large size of the rear wheel hub, which needed to accept a tripod joint.

                            This fortunately was still able to lock the rear rotors as during a braking event, the burden is largely placed
                            on the front brakes due to longitudinal load transfer.
